# Tetris - Java Swing Edition 🎮

A fully functional Tetris game developed using **Java Swing**.  
Inspired by the fast-paced online game [tetr.io](https://tetr.io/), this project was created as an exercise to gain exposure to game development and Java's GUI capabilities.

The game features clean block mechanics, scoring, level progression, and drop-speed adjustments as difficulty increases — all while following the classic Tetris rules.
